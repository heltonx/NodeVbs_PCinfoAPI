# VBS-NodeJs-PCinfo-API

The vbscript and the node.js file must be at the same directorty (As the powershell script just consumes the API exposed, it can be anywhere in the machine).

In that directory, do the following steps:

1) npm init -y (Initialize a new Node.js project);

2) npm install express (Install the Express.js package);

3) node server.js  (run this command to start the API server);

4) open the api link http://localhost:3000/computerinfo/ at your browser (or run the ps1).

------------
The /computerinfo endpoint is part of the API exposed by the server (whose source file is server.js). When a client makes an HTTP GET request to http://localhost:3000/computerinfo, the server receives the request, executes the VBScript code to retrieve the computer information, and sends back (to your browser or the ps1 script) the response in JSON format.

------------

NOTES

If (when running the ps1 script) you encounter an error similar to

    + CategoryInfo          : ErrodeSeguran√ßa: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

That's because the system does not authorize the operation. Solution:

Follow link can help. But anticipating, you ca run these two commands and will run:

1) Get-ExecutionPolicy (the result probably will be Restricted)

2) Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned (choose S or Y)
